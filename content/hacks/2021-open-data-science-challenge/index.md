## IronHacks Background
IronHacks a platform that provides seasoned and beginning data scientists the means to resolve pressing civic issues alongisde a community of like-minded individuals. As an open data platform, it offers granular datasets for computation and analysis. IronHackers are tasked with analyzing the data and devising a front-facing explanation to enable policymakers to make informed decisions. The IronHacks platform is simply the means for talented data scientists to put their efforts towards the greater good with a multi-phase and learning-oriented product development process. IronHackers are provided a no-setup programming environment and a plethora of tools they can use to develop novel models and visualizations that help policymakers make informed decisions. 

## The COVID-19 IronHack
COVID-19 has impacted our daily lives. As citizens get vaccinated and society slowly returns to the norm, governments and corporations need to understand citizens' economic and social activity.
Within Michigan, there has been a significant uptick of COVID-19 cases, and the question arose: _Will life ever be the same?_
Will it ever be safe to go to the cinema, a restaurant, to resume daily living? 
An increase of social activity can indicate a normalization of daily routines and economic activity. This creates risk, resulting in less precisely-measured metrics in locations such as closed buildings (see **[CDC](https://bit.ly/2UVHMCM)** news).  Your task is to predict the weekly foot traffic at core points of interest in Marion County, Indiana, to understand the ongoing COVID-19 impact and risk. We preprocessed large, actual, granular datasets from our partners (e.g. **[SafeGraph](http://safegraph.com)**) such as weekly footprint data at different points of interest in Marion County. Hackers will use this data to develop a predictive statistical model and communicate the results using data charts. IronHacks is offering data scientists the unique opportunity to help Marion County and leaders in the State of Indiana fight the COVID-19 pandemic. More details can be found in the [task statement] (https://ironhacks.com/hacks/covid-19-data-science-challenge-spring-2021/task). 
Our increasingly granular and actual data available will aid in answering those questions. With daily updated mobility and location data collected via our mobile phones, visitor counts at core places, regional spending data, unemployment claims, and so on, it will take the collective effort of a crowd of IronHackers to turn this data into something insightful and develop models that help us predict and expose the social and economic impact of COVID-19 at a granular level. 

## How will participants be evaluated?
In past competitions, each participant's notebook was evaluated in several dimensions. Examples are:
- The accuracy of your model's prediction (e.g. mean squared error)
- Your effort to explore a variety of solutions (data, models, etc.)
- Quality and usefulness of the presentation and interpretation of your data/models in a final interactive report (including data visualization)
- Quality of the software code
- More details on the evaluation criteria will be released at the start of the competition.

## What are the benefits?
In the 2021 Challenge, participants will have access to updated proprietary data they typically do not have access to, such as: social distancing behavioral data, foot traffic, COVID-19 incidents, and executive orders. This is the data typically referenced by state governments in the US as well scientists who learning about social movements during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Equipped with this data, participants will work in the IronHacks workspace with JupyterLab and access to BigQuery to create novel and useful statistical models and visualizations using Python and R. Participants will submit Jupyter notebooks and their outputs (html and markdown files). Doing so not only is good practice, but enables participants to win from the $1,000 pool of awards.

> "The excitement to know how my model would perform after every round kept me enthused till the end! These predictions can give insights into social distancing norms and implement necessary precautions."
- Feny Patel (Purdue University), 1st Place August 2020 Challenge

> "My greatest experience was being able to try on algorithms I never use. I also had the freedom to experiment, instead of defaulting to certain known models due to crunching code within 24 hours like typical hackathons."
- Harsha Pavuluri (Purdue University), 2nd Place August 2020 Challenge
