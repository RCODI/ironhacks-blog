## **Why Hack the Recovery?**

In 2020, the IronHacks team launched the COVID-19 Data Science Challenges as a unique opportunities for aspiring data scientists to "hack the pandemic". With the lockdown starting in 2020, COVID-19 has impacted our daily lives and social activity. The August 2020, Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 data science challenges encouraged data scientists at Purdue and other institutions to help governments and corporations understand the economic and social impact of COVID-19 in 2020. You can read more about those challenges [here](https://blog.ironhacks.com/hacks/2020-10-01-protect-purdue-hack/). Now in 2022, as the economy heads towards recovery, predicting unemployment becomes more important than ever to analyze people that are still left behind. 

In 2022, as citizens get vaccinated and governmental restrictions are lifted, citizens have started to increase their social activity: they start to travel, visit stores to shop, eat out, and attend public events like football games. These activities have opened up a variety of jobs. Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) now partners with IronHacks to provide you will real world data in Indiana to predict the unemployment trend in the area. 

## **What is Hack the Recovery about?**

The hack is all about monitoring and comparing unemployment levels in the state of Indiana. Wondering about the profiles of the people who are likely to make unemployment claims? This data science challenge will ask participants to predict the unemployment claims in Indiana using real world data. We preprocessed large, actual, granular datasets from our partner and we will stream them in real-time so that you can work with almost real-time data. This challenge will run for a week, offering participants the opportunity to learn while working with real-time data. There are multiple submission opportunities but only the two best submission count for the final scoring. The submission should contain predictive statistical models that you have tried. This long-term hack is a unique opportunity to help the society tackle the challenges of unemployment and help companies find the right talents that are out there. 


If you sign-up to our platform, you can follow along about updates and new challenges. 

## **How will participants be evaluated?**
In past competitions, each participant's notebook was evaluated in several dimensions with a focus on learning, exploration and creativity. So in this respect IronHacks is different from other competitions that are only focused on performance only.  Examples are:
- The **accuracy** of your analysis (e.g. the prediction accuray measured with the mean squared error or the correct descriptive analysis for a simpler challenge). 
- Your **learning effort** and creativity in **exploring** a variety of different data and models
- The **usefulness** of the presentation and interpretation of your data/models in a final interactive report.

More details on the evaluation criteria will be released at the start of the competition.

## What is the timeline?

### Hack the Recoery
This challenge opens for registration on November 2022. There are multiple submission opportunities, at which your solution will be scored in real-time. The last date to accept the rules is 15 November, 2022.  More details can be found after the registration to the challenge on www.ironhacks.com 


## Who is eligible? 

Everybody who:
1) speaks English 
2) is older than 16 years and 
3) has programming skills in **Python**.Â 

So what are you waiting for? 

## Why should you participate?

There are range of reasons why you should take up the challenge. 

* **Prizes**: Most of our challenges have prizes for the best individuals as well as the best teams. For example, in the Spring-Summer Challenge 2021 we will reward the top 5 submissions with Amazon giftcards. The rank will be based on the quality (accuracy) as well as the exploration effort/creativity of the participant submission. The total prize money varies and can range up to $5000. 
* **Certificates**: Every participant will receive a digital certificate for participation with logos of the sponsors.
* **Showcases**: We will share the best solutions on their website.
* **Learning experience**: As we have learned from prior participants, the iterative IronHacks  process (see more [here](www.ironhacks.com)) combined with the tools and features of the IronHacks platform offers a unique learning experience that is distinct from those you might have experienced on other sites (e.g. Kaggle.com)

And **do not forget** - your contribution is essential to fight unemployment.

*"The excitement to know how my model would perform after every round kept me enthused till the end! These predictions can give insights into social distancing norms and implement necessary precautions."*

**Feny Patel (Purdue University), 1st Place August 2020 Challenge**

*"My greatest experience was being able to try on algorithms I never use. I also had the freedom to experiment, instead of defaulting to certain known models due to crunching code within 24 hours like typical hackathons."*
