## The Fall 2022 IronHacks Training Challenge

> Learn to use Jupyter Notebooks and BigQuery for exploratory data analysis using Indiana Department of Workforce Development data to predict unemployment claims in Indiana!


The IronHacks challenge runs for 4 weeks, so it is geared towards learning and iteration. This means that even if you are new to data science it is an excellent opportunity for you to learn by doing! Further, this challenge focuses on a really important topic: predicting unemployment trend! 

## The task and the data: Predicting unemployment claims in the State of Indiana using DWD data

We ask you to predict the number of unemployment claims using historical data provided by DWD, as well as demographics data.  You are given variables such as race, education, categories of employers, week number, etc. Your task is to predict the total unemployment claims for a specific census tract in Indiana in a specific week. Using such data, your predictions will inform citizens as well as decision-makers like the State of Indiana, the Department of Workforce Development, and others about the potential impact of unemployment to the state.

## Your workspace

During the competition, you will use the new IronHacks workspace that supports a fully integrated data science workflow: You will have access to a **JupyterLab**, a key, and libraries to query and analyze data from **BigQuery**. Our workspace supports Python, R, and Julia. **Please note: For this competition, you will only be using Python.**  Please check out the workspace by clicking on the workspace button in the right corner.  

## Accessing the data in BigQuery
When you register for this new challenge,  you will be able to access a key in your [user profile](https://ironhacks.com/profile) that allows you to query the data using libraries in Python and some basic SQL. Our Tutorial #2, which will be available when registration opens, will tell you more about how to do that. We will release new keys in batches so it might take up to a day until you have access to a key! 

## Your submission

You will be asked to create a predictive statistical model that you can revise over time. You will be asked to produce and submit your results in a Jupyter notebook.  You can learn about the details of your submission in the task statement when it is released to all participants. You will have multiple opportunities for making a great submission. The task statement will detail the submission frequency and requirements, but generally, we strongly recommend you to submit often. 

## Evaluation

Each participant's notebook will be evaluated  in two dimensions using objective metrics: 

* **Prediction accuracy** (your modelâ€™s MSPE and MAPE)
* **Individual exploration and learning** (your effort to explore a variety of different models) 

The evaluation metrics and logic will be detailed in the task statement once it has been published. Please also carefully read the Rules when the competition is open for registration. 

## The process

* **Registration and warm-up phase**: When you register for the hack, you will have the opportunity to warm-up using our tutorials. You will also access to a subset of the data that you can use to get familiar with the data you will be using in the challenge. Registration is planned to open soon and will remain open for a period of time for new participants to join (this registration window is dependent upon challenge criteria for each hack).

* **Your start of the Competition**: The competition starts with you accepting the Rules of the competition.  Once we have released the task, you have to accept the rules of the contest, access your competition key, and start querying BigQuery.
 
 * **Multi-staged interim submission process**: After the release of the task, there are multiple submission opportunities over a six week period of time.  There are two submissions planned for each week so you can be scored two times for the same model focused on a particular week. We will get new data every week so you have the opportunity to tune your model every week further, as you get new data. 

We will create a Calendar for you to learn more about the dates and deadlines below.  

| **Event**                                    | **Date/Time (EST)**                   |

## Skills and tutorials

This fourth IronHacks is designed for participants with intermediate knowledge of statistics and Python. Beginners and more advanced users are also invited to participate. If you have never worked with Jupyter notebook, you can use the warm-up phase to practice. You will have access to check out the tutorials once registration is open. We will release more tutorials as needed. 

## Prizes and awards

In total, we will award several prizes with a total value up to **USD 2000** (to be confirmed). More details will be available in the upcoming Task Statement. 

In addition, there are more additional benefits for you: 

* Certificate: Every participant will receive a digital certificate for participation with logos of the sponsors.
* Showcases: We will publish selected models www.ironhacks.com at the end of the competition. In addition, our partners will also feature the best solutions on their website.
* Learning experience: Based on what we have learned from the past, IronHacks will offer a great learning experience and practice for data scientists.

And **do not forget** - your work is essential to help us contribute to knowledge and solutions surrounding unemployment. 

## Questions?

After registration, just check out or leave a note in our forum! There you find announcements. You can also contact us by clicking on the "Get in touch" button in the upper right corner. 


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **Where can I find  the tutorial material if I missed a live tutorial?**
