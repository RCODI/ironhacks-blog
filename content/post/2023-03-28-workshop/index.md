<h2 style="text-align: center">Computational Liberal Arts (CLA) and Computational Social Science (CSS) Workshop on IronHacks</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Studying humans in the age of code, data, and AI using computational methods and online experiments</em></p>

We are excited to invite faculty and graduate students in liberal arts and social sciences to a half-day workshop to learn about and discuss how to leverage [**IronHacks**](https://www.ironhacks.com), a platform developed at Purdue by the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation, for studing humans and their actions in today's world digital society shaped by data, code, and artificial intelligence (AI). 


## **What is the Workshop About?**
During the workshop, participants will learn how they can use IronHacks to perform computational research in the liberal arts (CLA) and social sciences (CSS) to develop advance and develop new theories using large-scale online experiments and analyzing trace data with computational methods. [**IronHacks**](https://www.ironhacks.com)is a platform for researchers in CLA and CSS to study how technically interested and savvy humans (programmers, data scientists, app developers, etc.) engage in data and code-related work and problem-solving to solve data-related challenges (e.g. developing a data science algorithm for forecasting unemployment, developing a data visualization to be shown on a website, designing a web app, etc.). Further, it allows studying many other code-related human actions. For example, it researchers can use IronHacks to study how end-users and humans without technical expertise interact with code, data, and artificial agents (e.g. recommender systems, bots, etc.) more broadly. The platform provides an opportunity for researchers to leverage the granular digital traces of human actions and interactions on and with digital platforms for developing and testing new theories in liberal arts and social sciences at different levels - individuals, groups, crowds, and collectives, as well as artifacts and design (Brunswicker et al., 2018) using computational methods (Gosling and Johnson, 2010). IronHacks also allows researchers to perform randomized controlled experiments which have long been considered the gold standard of scientific research (Recker, 2013). IronHacks allows scholars to move from the lab into the "field" while maintaining control of the experimental set-up. The participants in such research studies either come from the existing IronHacks community of programmers and data scientists, or can be recruited in a purposive way depending on the population of interest. 

## **Why should I participate as CLA researcher?**
There are a range of benefits from participating in this workshop: 
1. You have the opportunity to learn about, form and become part of the new field of computational liberal arts (CLA) and the emerging field of computational social sciences (CSS)
2. You get direct insights how the RCODI teams has used IronHacks in their prior research on digital innovation, crowds, and collective intelligence and data science learning/programming
3. You can discuss how you could use IronHacks to answer a research question of interest to you in your specific field of liberal arts and social science. Specifically, you will 
* see a demo of the Ironhacks platform and how to use it as a researcher
* understand what trace data you could collect and what methods could be used to analyze such data.
* listen to to the experiences of a recent participant in an IronHacks "challenge" - the so called hack, and learn about the practical experiences of those engaging in data science work on IronHacks
4. Understand why IronHacks offers greater potential for "realistic", and externally valid research on human behavior in the age of code, data, and AI compared to platforms like Kaggle,Topcoder, Mturk,Volunteer Sciences, O-tree, Apple appstore, Qualtrics, etc. 
5. Understand how you could integrate IronHacks in your own teaching
6. Develop ties to other researchers and the RCODI team to form a working group at Purdue, in which you design a joint research project, apply for grants, and advance the platform and its community to serve the needs of the new field of computational liberal arts (CLA) and also computational social science more broadly. 



### **Diverse Tasks & Topics Possible with IronHacks**

Possible topics of study with IronHacks might include computational anthropology (Diver, 2021), labor market analysis (Harding et al., 2018), trust (Kuwabara, 2015), etc (refer to the table below). 
How CLA researchers can use computatonal tools and algorithms to analyze substatntial amounts of real-time data, the analysis of social networks and online communities, ethics, security, privacy, social justice, misinformation, AI, biases, information disclosure, innovation, etc.

### **Research Opportunities**

Researchers can also use IronHacks to study the process of generating and evaluating new alternatives (search), as well as changes in beliefs and behaviors through experience (learning) in a natural setting. Many other opportunities with the platform are also available. 

### **Customizable Tasks and Experimental Possibilities**

With Ironhacks tasks can be customized to capture various features of a taxonomy. As previously notes, the platform also allows for customizable experimental research, enabling researchers to assess various treatment effects and capture digital trace data. <br>

IronHacks has been used for asynchronous experiments, while synchronous experiments are also feasible. While actors' actions on the platform are assumed to be independent, it is possible to implement dependent actions.

## **About the Organizer**

**Dr. Sabine Brunswicker** is an internationally recognized innovation scholar and computational social scientist, bridging the fields of social sciences and information science & technology. She is a Professor for Digital Innovation, and the Founder and Director of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI). 

In her research on digital innovation, she is particularly focused on the role of digital platforms as a means to leverage distributed machine and human intelligence when solving complex problems at scale. Examples of digital innovation she studies are Open source software (OSS) communities, crowdsourcing, citizen science, blockchains, and digital manufacturing. In her work, she designs and examines the social and technical ‘features’ of digital platforms with a focus on economic, social, and ecological outcomes. Further, she uses computational techniques (e.g. agent-based modeling, network analysis) and field experiments to advance theories and models of complex socio-technical interactions. Her work has been funded by NSF, NIH, the European Commission (EC), and industry and philanthropic donors.

## **Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI)**

The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) strives to engage in a revolution of innovation, researching the best way digital technologies can shape the process of open innovation. Open innovation combines an organization’s own research with additional information from external sources to solve problems and develop new products or services. With leading researchers from around the world participating, the center will become a thought leader in the rapidly evolving field. Leveraging big data, sentiment analysis, crowdsourcing, open data, living laboratories and real-time experimentation, the center will focus on how technologies can change the way innovations are realized.
