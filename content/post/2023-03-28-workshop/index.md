## **Benefits of Using IronHacks for Researchers:**

**IronHacks** is an experimental platform for social researchers to study emerging social phenomena in the field. The platform provides an opportunity for researchers to leverage the granular digital traces of human actions and interactions on and with digital platforms for developing and testing hypotheses related to individuals, groups, crowds, and collectives, as well as artifacts and platform architecture (Brunswicker et al., 2018) with advanced methods (Gosling and Johnson, 2010). The subjects enrolled in IronHacks are data scientists or programmers who are interested in tackling real-world problems. IronHacks employs randomized controlled experiments which have long been considered the gold standard of scientific research (Recker, 2013). IronHacks combines machine learning with large-scale digital experiments to offer completely new ways of developing and testing theory. To enable experimental research of various kinds, IronHacks has emerged as a digital platform for conducting experiments that are controlled by researchers themselves, thus enabling us to assess various treatment effects and reap digital trace data.

## **Purpose of Workshop for CLA Colleagues:**

We would like to  engage  scholars working in this area to collectively leverage resources and ideas to enable digital experimental research. Through presentations of empirical work and group discussions, this CLA sponsored workshop is intended to contribute a nuanced and grounded view of the opportunities in using IronHacks for implementing digital experiments. 
In the past, IronHacks has been used for asynchronous experiments , but synchronous experiments are also possible. We assume that actorsâ€™ actions on the platform are independent, but dependent actions are possible to implement. 

## **Potential Ironhacks Research Topics for CLA Colleagues**

Are you a scholar in social sciences, arts and humanities and want to study our new age of data, code, and AI? Do you want to use computational methods and experiments in the cloud to advance theories empirically?

We would like to announce an opportunity for CLA faculty and graduate students where we collaborate on these future topics & tasks. 

### **Suggested Tasks for Future IronHacks:**

- Forecasting & Trend Analysis 
- Global Health
- Large government databases for labor, poverty, etc.
- Economic Analysis

### **Suggested Topics for Researchers:**
- Social Networks
- Problem-Solving 
- Cognitive Behavior 
- Organizational Learning 
- Individual Learning 
- Artificial Intelligence

## **About the Organizer**

Dr. Sabine Brunswicker is an internationally recognized innovation scholar and computational social scientist, bridging the fields of social sciences and information science & technology. She is a Professor for Digital Innovation, and the Founder and Director of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI). 

In her research on digital innovation, she is particularly focused on the role of digital platforms as a means to leverage distributed machine and human intelligence when solving complex problems at scale. Examples of digital innovation she studies are Open source software (OSS) communities, crowdsourcing, citizen science, blockchains, and digital manufacturing. In her work, she designs and examines the social and technical â€˜featuresâ€™ of digital platforms with a focus on economic, social, and ecological outcomes. Further, she uses computational techniques (e.g. agent-based modeling, network analysis) and field experiments to advance theories and models of complex socio-technical interactions. Her work has been funded by NSF, NIH, the European Commission (EC), and industry and philanthropic donors.

## **Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI)**

The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) strives to engage in a revolution of innovation, researching the best way digital technologies can shape the process of open innovation. Open innovation combines an organizationâ€™s own research with additional information from external sources to solve problems and develop new products or services. With leading researchers from around the world participating, the center will become a thought leader in the rapidly evolving field. Leveraging big data, sentiment analysis, crowdsourcing, open data, living laboratories and real-time experimentation, the center will focus on how technologies can change the way innovations are realized.
