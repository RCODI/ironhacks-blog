## **Computational Liberal Arts (CLA) and Computational Social Science (CSS) Workshop on IronHacks:** 
Studying humans in the age of code, data, and AI using computational methods and online experiments.

We are excited to invite faculty and graduate students in liberal arts and social sciences to a half-day workshop to learn about and discuss how they can leverage "IronHacks" - a platform developed at Purdue by the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation  - for studing humans and their actions in the new age of data, code, and AI. Specifically, the workshop will focus on how this platform can facilitate computational resaerch in the liberal arts to develop new and advance theories using large-scale online experiments and analyzing trace data with computational methods. 


## **What is the Workshop About?**

**IronHacks** is a platform for researchers in CLA and CSS to study how humans engage in data science and interact with code, data, and even AI more broadly. The platform provides an opportunity for researchers to leverage the granular digital traces of human actions and interactions on and with digital platforms for developing and testing new theories in liberal arts and social sciences at different levels - individuals, groups, crowds, and collectives, as well as artifacts and design (Brunswicker et al., 2018) using computational methods (Gosling and Johnson, 2010). IronHacks also allows researchers to perform randomized controlled experiments which have long been considered the gold standard of scientific research (Recker, 2013). 

IronHacks combines machine learning with large-scale digital experiments, providing researchers with new ways of developing and testing theory. <br> The subjects enrolled in IronHacks are data scientists or programmers who are interested in tackling real-world problems. 

## **Why should I participate as CLA researcher?**
There are various benefits 

### **Diverse Tasks & Topics Possible with IronHacks**

IronHacks offers a wide range of future tasks and possible topics to study with IronHacks including computational anthropology (Diver, 2021) , labor market (Harding et al., 2018) , trust (Kuwabara, 2015), etc (refer to the table below). 

### **Research Opportunities**

Researchers can use IronHacks to study the process of generating and evaluating new alternatives (search), as well as changes in beliefs and behaviors through experience (learning) in a natural setting. Many other opportunities with the platform are also available. 

### **Customizable Tasks and Experimental Possibilities**

Tasks can be customized to capture various features of the taxonomy. The platform also allows for customizable experimental research, enabling researchers to assess various treatment effects and capture digital trace data. <br>

IronHacks has been used for asynchronous experiments, but synchronous experiments are also feasible. While actors' actions on the platform are assumed to be independent, it is possible to implement dependent actions.

## **About the Organizer**

**Dr. Sabine Brunswicker** is an internationally recognized innovation scholar and computational social scientist, bridging the fields of social sciences and information science & technology. She is a Professor for Digital Innovation, and the Founder and Director of the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI). 

In her research on digital innovation, she is particularly focused on the role of digital platforms as a means to leverage distributed machine and human intelligence when solving complex problems at scale. Examples of digital innovation she studies are Open source software (OSS) communities, crowdsourcing, citizen science, blockchains, and digital manufacturing. In her work, she designs and examines the social and technical â€˜featuresâ€™ of digital platforms with a focus on economic, social, and ecological outcomes. Further, she uses computational techniques (e.g. agent-based modeling, network analysis) and field experiments to advance theories and models of complex socio-technical interactions. Her work has been funded by NSF, NIH, the European Commission (EC), and industry and philanthropic donors.

## **Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI)**

The Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) strives to engage in a revolution of innovation, researching the best way digital technologies can shape the process of open innovation. Open innovation combines an organizationâ€™s own research with additional information from external sources to solve problems and develop new products or services. With leading researchers from around the world participating, the center will become a thought leader in the rapidly evolving field. Leveraging big data, sentiment analysis, crowdsourcing, open data, living laboratories and real-time experimentation, the center will focus on how technologies can change the way innovations are realized.
