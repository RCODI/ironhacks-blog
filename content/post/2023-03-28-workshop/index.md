Are you a scholar in social sciences, arts and humanities and want to study our new age of data, code, and AI?

Do you want to use computational methods and experiments in the cloud to advance theories empirically?

Announcing an opportunity for CLA faculty and graduate students!

IronHacks is hosting a workshop on 19th April, 2023, inviting social scientists to study humans in the cloud using online experiments and advanced computational methods. 

This workshop is hosted by Purdueâ€™s Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) and led by Dr. Sabine Brunswicker.
