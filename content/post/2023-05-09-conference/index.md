## **What is the workshop about?**
Jia Lin Cheoh and Prof. Sabine Brunswicker's research on IronHacks has been accepted for long oral presentations at the highly competitive [**9th International Conference for Computational Social Science**](https://www.ic2s2.org/) in Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 17 - 20, 2023. The authors' work on the dynamics of problem-solving receives three highly favorable reviews from the reviewers, with two reviewers supporting long oral presentations and one supporting open plenary sessions. 

In addition, the two scholars are furnished an oral presentation slot at the [**Open and User Innovation Conference**](https://www.the-klu.org/event-pages/oui-conference-2023) on July 10 - 11, 2023, at Kuhne Logistics University in Hamburg, Germany. The authors receive favorable reviews from two track chairs supporting them for a long oral presentation on collaborative problem-solving.
