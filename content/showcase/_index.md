The pandemic has shifted normal living as we know it, and for our Fall 2020 hack,
focused on that. By using granular spatial and temporal data of places of interest
    in Tippecanoe County, this challenge was to analyze foot traffic in Tippecanoe County
    to predict what areas will see a higher count.
    
 In cohorts, our participants had the opportunity to learn from their peers and
    reconstruct their model based on what others were doing. Our Fall 2020 IronHack
    on COVID-19 had fascinating results from participants who developed insightful
    models by creatively interpreting granular data supplied to them. Shown here
    are the top five data visualizations from our Fall 2020 hack.
